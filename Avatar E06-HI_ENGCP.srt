2
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:20,667
[Iroh] <i>We spend so much time</i>
<i>hiding who we really are,</i>

3
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:24,208
<i>making sure no one sees
the person we truly want to be.</i>

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,542
<i>So it's hard to remember there was a time</i>

5
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:32,708
<i>when we were truly excited
to show the world our true face.</i>

6
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:34,542
Very impressive.

7
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:38,125
That uniform suits you well.

8
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,625
Does it look right?
I had trouble with the shoulder guards.

9
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,833
There. Perfect.

10
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,708
- What… what is it?
- Nothing.

11
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:50,833
Tell me.

12
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,708
[sighs] Your gauntlets are laced
incorrectly, but no one will notice.

13
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:55,917
What? Help me fix it!

14
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,667
[Iroh] I remember
my first war council meeting.

15
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,542
They were smaller affairs back then.
More private.

16
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:07,250
Ozai, however, seems to enjoy
having an audience.

17
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,417
Father says
he welcomes different opinions.

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,083
I'd advise against testing that.
Best to observe and learn for now.

19
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,750
There.

20
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:22,542
How do I look?

21
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,750
Like a prince.

[exhales]

23
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,042
Why are we off course?
Who changed the heading?

24

[suspenseful music playing]

25
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:45,167
- Lieutenant Jee, I asked you a question.
- We were given new orders.

26
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,333
- New orders? By who?
- [Zhao] By me.

27
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:54,958
We've been playing catch-up for too long.
I think it's time for a new strategy.

28
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:56,292
You think?

29
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,667
I am the one hunting the Avatar.

30
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,292
I am in charge of this mission.

31
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,958
I am the commander of this ship.

32
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,208
And I

33
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:09,875
am an admiral.

34
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,833
Fire Lord Ozai saw fit to put me

35
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:18,083
in charge of all operations
related to the capture of the Avatar.

36
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:20,708
Of course I welcome your assistance.

37
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,625
In fact, I expect it.

38
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,417
I'll need
all the resources at my disposal,

39
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,000
no matter how minimal.

40
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,333
I'll come by later

41
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:36,750
to discuss a few personnel changes
<i>I'd </i>like to make.

42
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,167
Until then, carry on.

43
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,542
[Iroh] What's happened?

44
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,250
[Zuko] Lieutenant Jee,
resume our original course.

45
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,542
Did you hear me?

46
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,833
Resume course!

47
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,417
Do you know
what the punishment for mutiny is?

48
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,083
I do, and that's why
I can't do what you say.

49
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,167
Admiral Zhao was very clear
with these orders

50
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,292
and what would happen
if we didn't follow them.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,750
Are you seriously gonna let
this spineless slug tell us what to do?

52
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,167
He doesn't know what's at stake!

53
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,583
We can't let him come in and take it away.
Not after everything we've been through.

54
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:42,792
[Iroh] For the last three years,
we've only had each other,

55
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,625
and that's still true.

56
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,375
Only those of us on this boat
know what it's been like.

57
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:51,833
Zhao is not the one
who deserves your loyalty.

58
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,708
- Zuko is.
- [Jee] Loyalty?

59
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:58,958
General, with all due respect, your nephew
doesn't know the meaning of the word.

60
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:00,667
If he did, he would've shown us,

61
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,292
the people who've been with him
night and day for three years,

62
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,875
a lot more respect.

63
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:09,375
Instead, we've had to put up
with his insults and abuse and tantrums.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,917
He doesn't care
what we've had to sacrifice,

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,125
because he's never had
to sacrifice anything.

66
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,333
If you ask anyone here,
they'll tell you, "He may be a prince,

67
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:19,042
but he's not our prince."

68
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,583
Sir.

69
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,000
I know Zuko has his rough edges.

70
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:37,417
But you must understand
he's been through a lot.

71
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,083
And he knows far more about sacrifice
than you can ever know.

72

[Aang] Greetings, wise sages.
I'm glad to see you.

Uh, my name is Aang, and I'm here
to visit the shrine of Avatar Roku.

79
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:13,875
You see,

80
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,667
I'm the Avatar.

81
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,750
We know.

- [Aang] Wait!
- [man grunts]

I'm a friend.

This will take us
to Avatar Roku's shrine. Quickly.

90
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,500
[man] He must be close.

91
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,833
[man 2] Search everywhere!

- [creature sniffs]

95
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,417
[creature grunts]

96
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay, Nyla. Let's go.

97
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,000
My name is Shyu.

98
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:14,458
I believe the Avatar
represents not any one kingdom

99
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:16,708
but the hope of a unified world.

100
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,125
Sadly, the Great Sage
and the others believe

101
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,000
the Fire Lord
is their true spiritual leader.

102
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,417
They have lost their way.

103
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,000
So all of this belonged to Roku?

104
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,500
[Shyu] These are relics
from previous Avatars

105
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,208
that my grandfather gathered
for safekeeping.

106
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,833
[door closes]

107
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:39,083
[footsteps approaching]

108
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,007
[Aang] I need to make contact
with Avatar Roku.

109
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,667
He's the only one
who can tell me how to save my friends.

110
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,167
I will hold them off for as long as I can.

111
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,583
Step aside.

112
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:59,083
Great Sage, this boy's the Avatar.
He is a hope for the world.

113
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,917
Remember the teachings of Avatar Roku.

114
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,292
Fire is not meant
to dominate the other elements.

115
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,583
It should exist in balance with them.

116
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:11,667
The only one who can provide balance
is Fire Lord Ozai.

117
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,250
He will unify the world, not the Avatar.

118
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,708
And you have no idea
how powerful he will soon become.

119
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,125
Now, for the last time,

120
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,500
step aside.

121
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:27,208
I can't do that.

122
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:32,375
Then you shall burn
along with the rest of the nonbelievers.

123
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,875
[mystical whirring]

124
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:46,792
[Roku] Who dares disturb
the peace of the Avatar?

125
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,542
Uh, it's me. Aang.

126
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:54,875
Is it not customary
to bow before your elders?

127
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:59,292
And to avert your eyes?

128
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,542
And hop on one leg?

129
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:08,708
[laughing]

130
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,708
Forgive me!

131
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:12,208
I couldn't resist.

132
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:13,917
It's good to see you, Aang,

133
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,375
but what took you so long?

134
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,958
I thought you would come
to seek my advice sooner.

135
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:20,875
[Aang] Avatar Kyoshi told me

136
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,958
that I need to figure things out
on my own.

137
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:24,625
That it was part of my journey.

138
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,500
Sounds like her.

139
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,542
Kyoshi has always been kind of…

140
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:30,792
[grunts]

141
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:32,833
[chuckles]

142
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:36,708
I thought you'd all be like that.
Aren't Avatars incarnations of each other?

143
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:40,375
We share the same spark,
but we are our own people.

144
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm different from Kyoshi,

145
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,542
just as you are different
from either of us.

146
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:49,167
For instance, what did Kyoshi tell you
the role of the Avatar was?

147
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,500
She said I need to be
a fierce, merciless warrior.

148
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:57,167
Yes, there are times when the Avatar
must resort to force and intimidation,

149
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,375
but in addition to being a warrior,

150
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,958
the Avatar must also be a diplomat.

151
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:06,250
So we can solve the world's problems
without hurting anyone?

152
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:11,167
We can try,
but there are consequences if we fail.

153
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:15,458
Painful… consequences.

154
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:22,417
But like Kyoshi,
I am here to aid you in your journey.

155
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,750
Anything you need.

156
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,167
It has to do with Koh.

157
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,542
Anything but that.

158
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,917
- You don't understand...
- No, <i>you </i>don't understand.

159
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,292
Koh is a predatory spirit

160
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,958
who can hurt you in ways
you can't imagine.

161
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:36,583
Just ask Avatar Kuruk.

162
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:39,458
I don't have a choice,
and I'm running out of time.

165
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:45,417
Please.

166
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,333
I heard you defeated him once.

167
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:48,750
No, I never defeated him.

168
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:52,000
I only managed to take something from him.

169
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:56,375
[Koh] Perhaps you've come
to return what you stole from me.

170
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,917
What did you take?

171
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,583
[Roku] A totem that represents something
that Koh needs and cannot forget.

172
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,375
The pendant belonged
to the Mother of Faces,

173
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:13,833
an ancient spirit
who crafted faces for all living beings.

174
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:20,250
It's because of her
that identity came into this world.

175
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,375
And she

176
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,167
is Koh's mother.

177
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,417
Koh longs for the same thing we all do.

178
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,625
Family.

179
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,708
[Aang] A totem?

180
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,042
Sounds like something
he'd be willing to trade for.

181
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,417
Thank you, Roku.

182
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,583
Aang!

183
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,125
I hope that you're able
to save your friends.

184
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,250
But the truth is,
for the Avatar, friends can be…

185
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,583
a liability.

186
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:52,083
The Avatar has to make
the impossible choices,

187
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:55,208
placing the world's needs
ahead of your needs.

188
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:57,583
On that, Kyoshi and I agree.

189
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,375
Trust me.

190
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,875
It'll save you and the ones you love

191
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,583

So you're the Avatar, huh?
Not sure what all the fuss is about.

204
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,125
You need to let me go.

205

No, really. You need to let me go.

206

People are depending on me.
You don't know what's at stake.

207
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,792
I've heard the stories
about how you're gonna save the world.

208
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:50,792
Here's the thing.

209
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,375
Some of us don't need saving.

210
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,958
Some of us
have got this world figured out.

211
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,000
You got your Firebenders
and your Earthbenders

212
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,750
and your whatever-benders,

213
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,167
and they all want something.

214
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,750
They're all willing to fight to get it.

215
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,500
So if you're smart, you just sit back
and wait for the dust to clear

216
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,167
and then pick through broken pieces
for the leftovers.

217

Far as I'm concerned,
world's just fine the way it is.

I trust you. You know why?

Because if there's any missing,
you'll come after us?

Because you're so cute.

What happened to you?

[Li] The Earth Kingdom's forces
are concentrated along the southern coast.

We tried flanking them,
but they keep lengthening the line.

[man] How about a pincer move?

246
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,542
They're anchored by cliffs.
They can outflank any attacks.

What would you do?

Um…

252

Horns tactic. Enveloping flanks,
leaving an escape route to draw them out.

Didn't you hear the general?
They're protected by cliffs on one side.

254

Tundra tanks to come over the top.

255

They're Earthbenders.

256

Our tanks would be

[Li] We could advance a division… here.

With the enemy's firepower
focused on that diversion,

262
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:54,375
we can launch pinning attacks
here… and here.

263
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,508
If you send them into the heart
of their forces, how will they retreat?

They won't.

265

But they'll be lost.

The 41st. They're mostly new recruits.

They're expendable.

[Zhao] Of course we do.

Just as we all know
you're in defiance of my orders,

293
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:57,917
which means that by disrespecting me,
you're dishonoring your father,

which, I guess, shouldn't be surprising,
given the stories I've heard.

to lend them to me.

It's said
they can shoot the wings off a glowfly

this shouldn't be
much of a challenge for them.

Then straight to Capital City.

I'm sure the Fire Lord
is eager to take possession of his prize.

we can make it to Pohuai by nightfall.

- Watch out for the Archers.

Pohuai Stronghold is impenetrable.

Why do you think
Zhao told us he was going there?

317
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,958
He knows attacking it would be suicide.

318
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:41,583
Entire armies have tried and failed.

319
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:45,792
Not only that, but Pohuai lies
inside Fire Nation borders.

320
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,958
Going there would violate your banishment.

- But Ozai does, and if he finds out...

322
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,417
- But the Avatar...
- He's lost!

323
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,625
- For now.
- [Zuko yells]

324
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,792
[Iroh] Right now, Zhao has the upper hand.

325
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:04,375
But sooner or later, he'll make a mistake,
and that's when we can make our move.

326
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,667
Until then,

327
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:07,833
patience.

328
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:16,542
[dramatic music playing]

329
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:28,917
[door opens]

330
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,201
[Zhao] Make sure you get this.

331
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,292
The Fire Lord will wanna know
all the details of the Avatar's capture.

332
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,375
Make it clear
I spared no effort in securing him.

333
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,083
And we should add a few thoughts
from the Avatar himself.

334
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,667
If not for the Fire Lord,
then for posterity.

335
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:46,167
Now,

336
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:48,917
Avatar,

337
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,125
had you heard of my name
before your capture,

338
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,625
or was this the first time?

339
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,708
Please. You have to let me go.

340
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:58,750
No, no. There are four guards, not three,

341
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:03,375
and both his hands
and his feet are shackled.

342
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,958
- Make sure you get it right.
- There are innocent lives at stake!

343
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:09,458
I can't let everyone down again.

344
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:12,792
Not again.

345
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,250
If I were you,

346
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:21,833
I'd be thinking less about my past

347
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,000
and more about my future.

348
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,042
It's not my future I'm worried about.

349
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,083
Really?

350
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,583
I mean, I'd worry a little.

351
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,417
Oh, you won't be killed.

352
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,250
If you die, you'll just be reborn.

353
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,833
We'd have to begin our search
for the Avatar all over again,

354
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:42,167
so… you'll live.

355
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,167
Though not well.

356
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:46,792
[chuckles]

357
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,667

[foreboding music playing]

360

Blow all the hot air you want.
It won't change your fate.

361
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,708
What are you doing? Don't write that down.

362
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:16,708
[door opens]

363
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:24,125
We are the loyal sons
and daughters of fire,

364
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:28,000
the superior element.

365
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:33,000
Until now, only one thing
stood in our path to victory.

366
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,583
The Avatar.

367
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:41,458
And today, we've done something
no one has been able to do.

368
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:46,333
We have captured the Avatar!

369
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:48,375
[cheering]

370
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,917
This is just the first step.

371
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,750
There will be mighty battles to be fought.

372
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:56,375
But not tonight.

373
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,625
Tonight,

374
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:02,667
we will celebrate!

375
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:08,750
We will praise the glory
of the Fire Nation!

376
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,917

[sentry] Did you get everything?

382
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:54,875
[driver] You know it.
As much wine as I could haul.

383
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:00,208
[sentry] Gonna be some night, huh?

384
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:05,375
Let's hope there's less firespitting
than Ahn's birthday.

Make sure to include
the full transcript of my speech,

421
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:04,625
but change "loyal" to "faithful."

422
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:05,792
It sounds more personal.

423

Also, make sure the Great Sage
has everything he needs for his research.

- I'm trying to help.
- I don't need your help.

490
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:04,833
Fine.

491
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:06,500
Have it your way.

492
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,375
What?

493
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:26,458
Nothing.

494

[groans]

495
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:35,083
Can I ask you something?

496
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,792
It might be a little personal.

497
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:43,792
Goat hair or rabbit?

498
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:49,625
Your calligraphy brush.
Goat hair or rabbit?

499
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:54,917
Your characters are so neat.
I mean, I could never get mine like that.

500
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,667
Monks used to say lemur droppings
were more legible than my brush strokes.

501
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:07,875
Look,

502
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:11,083
I know I shouldn't have
taken your notebook,

503
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:12,917
and I'm sorry.

504
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,958
It's been a lifesaver. Really.

505
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,625
You have information
on all the past Avatars

506
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,458
that no one else has.

507
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:26,625
All the Air Nomad monks, they're all gone.

508
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:29,542
So all I had was your notebook.

509
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:33,583
I can't tell you
how many nights I stayed up reading it.

510
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:35,917
You helped me a lot.

511
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,750
I mean, <i>it </i>helped me a lot.

It's stiffer, more control.

515
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,833
My teachers
made me practice every morning.

516
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:02,439
I wasn't allowed to do fight training

517
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,750
until I had done 100 vertical strokes
and 100 horizontal.

518
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:06,875
Me too!

519
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:10,542
Except mine were for spiritual studies.

520
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:14,083
A lot of the time, when I was supposed
to be meditating, I was actually sleeping.

521
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:17,625
I always got caught.
Probably didn't help that I snored.

522
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,833
Those guys out there, they're Fire Nation.

523
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:30,458
Yes.

524
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:33,917
So they're on your side.
Why are you fighting them?

525
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,083
They're not on my side.

526
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,667
But they will be.
When I capture you and bring you back, I…

[sighs]

528
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:50,208
If I catch you, I can go home.

529
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:54,208
Then I can take my place
as the rightful heir to the Fire Lord.

530
00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:57,125
And that's what you want?
To be the next Fire Lord?

531
00:35:57,208 --> 00:36:00,500
Yes. Of course.
It's what everyone expects of me.

532
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:05,792
Gyatso.

533
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:07,750
He was my teacher.

534
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,292
He said we can't worry about
anyone else's expectations.

535
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:15,542
I know. It's not that easy.

536
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:20,792
I mean, I'm the Avatar,
and… it's what everyone expects of me.

537
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:23,958
All I do is worry about that.

[emotional music playing]

539

Maybe you don't have to be
like the other Firebenders.

540
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,417
Maybe you could be better than them.

541
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:39,000
You know
what the Fire Lord is doing is wrong,

542
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:41,500
so you don't have to be like him.

543
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,500
You can show some compassion.

544
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:50,875
How dare you?

545
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,042
I'm the Crown Prince of the Fire Nation.
I'll be the example for all Firebenders.

546
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:59,375
And my father is a <i>great </i>man.

Compassion?

548
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:08,250
Compassion is a sign of weakness.

But… I'm… I'm here to duel General Li.

556
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:45,792
You're here because you have no respect
for our military.

- That's not true.
- [Ozai] Really?

Even when they come up
with terrible plans?

My plans!

00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:58,042
My strategy. My military.
That's what you have insulted.

[Zuko] Forgive me, Father.
I meant no disrespect.

Don't do this.

Rise and fight, Prince Zuko,

so you can learn some respect.

00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:52,250
how you and the others
were assigned this mission?

612

[Iroh] The doctor is creating
a special herbal balm just for you.

And the good news is,
he says your vision will be fine,

614
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:05,500
which means you have the good fortune
of continuing to bask in my beauty.

- He's hurt.

- He'll recover.
- But he'll never heal.

619

The doctor says you'll recuperate quickly.

620
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,958
It's a sign your body is strong.
That's good.

621
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:33,792
Your spirit, however,

622
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:36,583
still needs strengthening.

623
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:48,042
You held back today.

624
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,292
Maybe you saw that as a sign of respect,
but it wasn't.

625
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:54,042
It was weakness.

626
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:58,125
You must purge that weakness out of you.

627
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,917
You must be willing to give up the weak
to make yourself strong.

That is what makes us the Fire Nation.

That is why we sacrifice

will prove to be a better teacher.

[crying]

654

The 41st?

655
00:44:52,417 --> 00:44:53,833
We're the 41st.

656
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,125
And you're all alive
because of my nephew's sacrifice.

657
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,375
[man] There's something out there.

658
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:15,292
[Iroh] It's him. Drop the lines!

- [indistinct yelling]
- [chain clacking]

660
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:25,125
- [Iroh] You're injured.
- I'm fine.

661
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:26,792
We should have someone look at it.

662
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,792
I've dealt with worse.

663
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:34,000
I'm not going to ask you where you went,
but in the future, nephew,

664
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:38,208
I would appreciate it if you let me know
whether or not you're still alive.

665
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:41,792
There actually are a few of us
who care about…

666
00:45:43,917 --> 00:45:45,042
about such things.

667

[footsteps approaching]

[soldiers] Huh!

670
00:45:54,792 --> 00:45:57,667
Our prince… has returned.

671
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:00,917
- Hup!
- [men] Hup!

672
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,500
What's going on?

673
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:11,250
They must've missed you at music night.

674

[Iroh] <i>It's amazing how far we'll go</i>
<i>to hide our true selves from the world.</i>

676
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:08,542
<i>Perhaps it's because
we don't want people to know</i>

677
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,417
<i>how much they really mean to us…</i>

[Momo chattering]

[mystical whirring]

683
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:33,958
[Iroh] <i>Risk our lives.</i>

684
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:38,167

[Iroh] <i>But I suppose it can be scary</i>

691
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:39,625
<i>Some might see that

- [woman] How do you feel?

695
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:53,208
[Iroh] <i>After all, what greater pain</i>

[Aang] Gyatso?

698
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:03,750
[Iroh] <i>…finding out someone you love</i>
<i>has left you behind.</i>

699
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:10,208
Can we talk about it when I get back?

700
00:49:11,792 --> 00:49:13,000
Of course.

701
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:16,125
Once I save my friends,
we'll have more time.

702
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:35,333
[Iroh] <i>I guess that's why we feel the need</i>
<i>to hide away and protect ourselves.</i>

703
00:50:09,292 --> 00:50:10,917
<i>So we put on a mask.</i>
